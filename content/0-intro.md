**Welcome to my blog!**

<br>

My name is Ahmed. I'm a data scientist living in France. This blog is a personal project I'm embarking on to present some work I'm developing independently. It'll be about machine learning projects inspired from both my work and the open source community.

In future posts, I'll write about some use-cases I'll make, some tools I enjoy using or some reading material I find worth sharing. All the code will be also hosted on my github <a href="https://github.com/ahmedbesbes">account</a>

This is also a space where **you** can collaborate. So if something needs clarification or any further details, or if a mistake needs correction, don't hesitate to point it out: you can either post in the comment section below or submit an issue on github.

Hope to see you around.
