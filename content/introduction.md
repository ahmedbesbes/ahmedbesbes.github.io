**Welcome to my blog!**

<br>

My name is Ahmed. I'm a junior data scientist living in France. This blog is a personal project I'm embarking on to present some work I'm developing independently. It'll be about data analytics with a focus on machine learning.

In future posts, I'll write about some data science use-cases I'll make, some tools I enjoy using or some reading material I find worth sharing.

I do not pretend expertise. I'm writing about things I just learnt. So if you spot any mistake please don't hesitate to point it out.

Also if you have any recommendation that could improve this blog, I'm all ears and the comment section is yours.


Hope to see you around.
