Title: Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning from scratch
Date: 2019-08-31 12:00
Category: Deep Learning Introduction
Tags: Deep Learning, Tutorial, workshop, slides, presentation
Authors: Ahmed Besbes
Summary: If you're willing to understand how neural networks work behind the scene and debug the back-propagation algorithm step by step by yourself, these slides should be a good starting point. <br> We will cover deep learning popular applications, the concept of the artificial neuron and how it relates to the biological one, the perceptron and the multi-layer one. We'll also dive in activation functions, loss functions and **formalize the training of a neural net via the back-propagation algorithm.** <br> In the last part, you'll learn how to code a fully functioning trainable neural network from scratch. In pure python code only, with no frameworks involved. <br><br><p align="center"><img src="/images/article_9/deep_learning_intro.png" style="width:85%"></p>
