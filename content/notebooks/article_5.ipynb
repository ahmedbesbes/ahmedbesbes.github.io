    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are rapid findings I think are worth sharing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bag of word models using character ngrams can be very efficient. **Do not underestimate them!**. They are relatively cheap to compute, and also easy to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RNNs are powerful. However, you can sometimes pump them with external pre-trained embeddings like GloVe. You can also use other popular embeddings such as word2vec and FastText.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CNNs can be applied to text. They have the main advantage of being very fast to train. Besides, their ability to extract local features out of text is particularly interesting to nlp tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RNNs and CNNs can be stacked together to take advantags of both architectures.\n",
    "\n",
